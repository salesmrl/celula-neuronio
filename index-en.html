      <h1>Neuron Structure</h1>
      <div class="escrita1">
        A neuron is composed of several specialized parts
        <br />that
        <span class="destaque1"
          >work together to allow communication between nerve cells.</span
        >
      </div>
      <div class="escrita2">
        <span class="destaque1">CELL BODY</span>
        <br /><br />
        Also known as soma, it is the control center <br />of the neuron. Here,
        the genetic information <br />is stored in the nucleus and protein
        synthesis <br />and cell maintenance occur. <br /><br />
        <span class="destaque1">DENDRITES</span>
        <br /><br />Dendrites are extensions branching from the <br />cell body
        and receive signals from other <br />neurons or sensory cells. They have
        receptors <br />that detect neurotransmitters released by other
        <br />neurons, allowing the signal to be transmitted. <br /><br />
        <span class="destaque1">AXON</span>
        <br /><br />The axon is a long, thin extension that <br />transmits
        signals to other neurons or <br />effector cells. It is covered by a
        myelin sheath, <br />which helps speed up signal transmission. The axon
        terminals are the ends of the axon that release neurotransmitters,
        chemical substances that transmit signals to other neurons or cells.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="destaque1">SYNAPSES</span>
        <br /><br />Synapses are junctions between two neurons or between
        <br />a neuron and an effector cell. They allow <br />communication
        between nerve cells, enabling signals to be transmitted efficiently and
        precisely. <br /><br />
        <span class="destaque1">MYELIN SHEATH</span>
        <br /><br />The myelin sheath surrounds the axon of some neurons,
        playing a crucial role in transmitting nerve signals.

      <h1>Neuron Functions</h1>
      <div class="escrita3">
        Neurons have several important functions in the nervous system. They are
        responsible for transmitting electrical and chemical signals to other
        neurons or cells, processing sensory, motor, and cognitive information,
        and communicating with each other through synapses. In addition, neurons
        integrate signals from different sources to generate appropriate
        responses and control body functions such as movement, sensation,
        cognition, and emotion. There are different types of neuronal functions,
        including sensory, motor, and cognitive functions.
      </div>
      <div class="escritainterna">
        <b>SENSORY FUNCTIONS</b> involve detecting sensory stimuli and
        transmitting information to the central nervous system. Motor functions
        involve transmitting signals to muscles and glands, controlling movement
        and other body functions.
      </div>
      <div class="escritainterna2">
        <b>COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS</b> are involved in processes such as thinking,
        perception, attention, and memory. In summary, neurons play a
        fundamental role in transmitting and processing information in the
        nervous system, allowing the body to respond to stimuli and perform
        complex functions.
